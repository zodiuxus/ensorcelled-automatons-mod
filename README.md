# Ensorcelled Automatons

## Magi-mechanical little helpers

This mod is very old and is mostly as a showcase for my early beginnings in Minecraft modding.

It's also been sitting on my computer for a year and I haven't come close to it due to time constraints, so I decided to upload it.
Used to work when I started it, but due to changes to its dependencies and likely Gradle, it no longer
is able to configure the root project, let alone run the mod itself.
